# Execute Agent (Deprecated)

## /agent-studio/public-api/agents/:agentId/execute

This endpoint has been deprecated and may be replaced or removed in future versions of the API.

Deprecated endpoint - use POST /agent/:agentId/execute instead.

Executes the specified agent and returns a non-streaming JSON response with the complete agent output. The agent must be in active status and belong to the specified location. locationId is required in the request body.

Session Management:

* For the first message in a new session, do not include the executionId in the request payload.
* The API will return an executionId along with the agent response, which uniquely identifies this conversation session.
* To continue the conversation within the same session, include the executionId from the previous response in subsequent requests.
